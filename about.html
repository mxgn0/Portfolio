        <h2>Max J.</h2>
        <p>
            Max Jänichen (born 1995 in Freiberg, Saxony, Germany)
is a 3D Artist specialized in procedural simulations, motion design and contemporary art.

He started modeling and animating at the age of 12 using Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya, and later created his first visuals, cover artworks, intro animations and advertising content in Cinema4D combined with After Effects.

After working for a small marketing agency and several visualization projects in Saxony during his studies in Media Informatics and Interactive Entertainment, he aimed for more complex and detail-oriented designs.
However, he quickly reached the limitations of traditional 3D workflows in 2018, which were only expandable through C4D plugins and third-party tools.

This led him to learn Houdini, a software that fundamentally changed his approach to creation through its procedural and simulation-based workflow — and sensitized him to thinking in systems, generative structures and digital materiality.

Today, his work merges artistic expression, physical logic and technical innovation to build dynamic visual worlds that feel alive, evolving and emotionally resonant.
