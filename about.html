        <h2>Max J.</h2>
            <p>(born 1995 in Freiberg, Saxony, Germany)</p>
            <p>is a 3D Artist specialized in procedural simulations, motion design and contemporary art.</p>
            <p>He started modeling and animating at the age of 12 using Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya, later producing his first visuals, cover artworks, intro animations and advertising content in Cinema 4D combined with After Effects.</p>
            <p>After working for a small marketing agency and several visualization projects in Saxony during his academic years, he completed a B.Sc. in Media Informatics & Interactive Entertainment, where he strengthened his technical foundation in computer graphics, real-time systems and digital production workflows.</p>
            <p>While developing more complex compositions and detail-driven visual elements around 2018, he increasingly reached the structural limits of conventional 3D pipelines that depended on plugins and closed toolchains. Rather than extending software through add-ons, he sought a methodology that would allow him to build motion graphics, physical behaviors and procedural structures from the ground up — with full control over logic, data flow and material behavior.</p>
            <p>This pursuit led him toward Houdini’s procedural and simulation-based framework, enabling an approach centered on system-building, emergent detail, generative motion and digital materiality.</p>
            <p>Today, his work merges artistic expression, physical logic and technical innovation to create dynamic visual environments that behave, evolve and resonate like living systems.</p>
